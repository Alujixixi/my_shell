操作指南：
在这里打中文太难受了，我下面就打英文了
For now, I created three files:
	main.c
	function.c
	function.h
	testFunction.c

most functions will be writen in function.c, and add declaration in function.h
main.c will use functions in function.h though #inlclude "function.h"

I alse created testFunction.c in order to test the functions in function.c

To run the program, you need to compile and link use the commends follow:

compile the main program
gcc -c main.c -o main.o

if you have modified function.c,then you need to compile function.c
gcc -c function.c -o function.o

after compile, do link them, "shellexe" is a name,you can name it as you like
gcc main.o function.o -o shellexe

you can also use ./compile.sh to compile quickly

finally run it
./shellexe

When useing testFunction.c to test, take it like main.c, 
compile, link and run it.
